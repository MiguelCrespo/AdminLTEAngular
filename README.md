Removed additional plugins that this theme brought to make more easier to user customize his theme (Avoiding many files) and implementing **bower** to manage them, actually there are only:

 - **Angular**
 - **JQuery**
 - **Bootstrap**

Also implemented grunt and a node server to avoid the use of apache or whatever else to serve the HTML files.

*Just Javascript <3!*


----------


###**Steps to run this theme:**

 - Install **Bower** and **Grunt** (If you do not have already):

    sudo npm install -g bower grunt-cli

 - Install **node** modules:

    npm install

 - Install **bower** dependencies:

    bower install

 - Run the server and that's all!! :D

If everything was ok you should have a new tab in your browser with the theme running...
